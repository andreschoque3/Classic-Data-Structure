This is a classic data structure: a Threaded Binary Tree

A binary tree serves to perform insert/delete functions, and search functions. These binary trees are composed of a finite set of ‘nodes’ that contain either empty sets 
or a root where two of these also called left and right ‘subtrees’ contain number values. The roots of the subtrees are called children.There is a simple mathematical 
approach to determine the space requirement. It is: n(2P + D) where n is the number of nodes, and P is the space required in the pointer, and D is the space required in 
the data value.
